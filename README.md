# discord_online_research_ai_sphere
A compilation of the discord online sphere for ai research stuff
##TODO!: site:huggingface.co "discord.gg" discord gg for other keywords too eg office hours, checked the chinese servers ,  the discord.gg trick to find more servers, and a small writeup on what they are + the ones im leaving (all are academic/research/funding, but not all are active or in ai ; compsci and hard science sphere),github and baidu to find the chinese ; header links etc

Notes: There is a decent chunk of servers ;notably on discordesp if you search by popularity that are just dead
was active like 3-4 years ago, but dead now
Esp common for social servers
 I will not be cataloguing compsci,hacking servers since those are ever shifting and findable on disboard, github , easily
